# Good README Generator
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app: What is the app for? How do you use the app? How do you install it? How do you report issues? How do you make contributions? This command-line application allows for an efficient, easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This allows a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.
